This is a very simplified example of a real Excel daily report that I automated for a colleague.

The result of this automation was the aproximately 20 minutes worth of work every day, as we had around 5.000 rows per report.

So basically this report is linked to another report -that I also automated- and divid the info per market and show us
how many units for every market are Ready To Load or Complete, meaning the warehouse has already proccessed them, and which ones
are still pending for the warehouse to be processed.

I am leaving Iberia tab un-hiden to make it easier to understand how the spredsheet works, but to make it more simple to the 
person using this report I had all them hiden.

The person only had to save the new file they would receive every day from me and then click update all and that would update 
the date in "On pick calculator" tab that it was the info they needed.
