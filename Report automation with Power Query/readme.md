This is a simplified example of a real Excel daily report that I automated when I was working for New Balance. Note: the data has been anonymized for customer and company privacy.

The result of this automation was aproximately 20 minutes worth of work every day, as we had around 5.000 rows per report that we had to filter and separe in different tabs in an Excel document.

How it works is: this report is linked to another one and divides the info per market and show us how many units for every market are Ready To Load or Complete (meaning the warehouse has already proccessed them) and how many are still pending to be processed by the warehouse.

I have left Iberia tab un-hiden to make it easier to understand how the spredsheet works. The other tabs are hiden but can be unhideen by the viewer.

With the creation of this automated report we only had to save the new file that we would receive every day and overwrite the root document where the automated Excel takes the info from and then click update all and that would update the data in the "On pick calculator" tab.
